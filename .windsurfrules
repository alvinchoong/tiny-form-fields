Always refer to README.md for guidance on code, file organisation, and tasks.

## Directories

- `src/`: source code
- `tests/`: test code
- `tasks/`: task files
- `dist/`: compiled code

## Writing code

### The smallest possible change

For example, if a task requires "Add checkbox to toggle Show/Hide", many would implement it as:

    1. Add a new field to the model
    2. Add checkbox UI and wire up events
    3. Implement the show/hide logic
    4. Add styling/animations

But that's actually too many changes at once! Instead, we should do it as:

#### Iteration 1: Just the model
    - Add boolean field to model
    - Update decoder/encoder
    - Nothing else

#### Iteration 2: Just the UI presence
    - Add checkbox element
    - Wire up event handler
    - Nothing else

#### Iteration 3: Just the logic
    - Implement show/hide logic
    - Nothing else

#### Iteration 4: Just the UX
    - Add styling/animations
    - Nothing else

Each iteration above is "the smallest possible change". Never combine them into one iteration.

### One iteration at a time

1. Make only the smallest possible change at every iteration
2. Run `make build` to confirm it didn't break anything
    - if something broke, it means the change was incomplete; make the remaining changes instead of only fixing the error
3. Only if that's successful, then ask for permission to make the next smallest change (repeat step 1 and 2)

## Tasks

- All code changes should correspond to a checkbox in tasks/
- When a change is completed
    - run `make build` to confirm it doesn't break anything
    - update the checkbox in tasks/
- If all checkboxes are checked, update tasks/README.md and rename the task file from TODO to DONE.
