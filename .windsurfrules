Always refer to README.md for guidance on code, file organisation, and tasks.

## Directories

- `src/`: source code
- `tests/`: test code
- `tasks/`: task files
- `dist/`: compiled code

## Writing code

### The smallest possible change

For example, we a task requires a new field to be added to our state.

    - Adding a new field
    - Making logic changes based on the new field's value
    - Making style changes
    - Introducing ux changes to manipulate the value of the new field

The above are actually 4 separate "smallest possible change" to be done in 4 separate iterations. Don't do them in the same iteration!

### One iteration at a time

1. Make only the smallest possible change at every iteration
2. Run `make build` to confirm it didn't break anything
    - if something broke, it means the change was incomplete; make the remaining changes instead of only fixing the error
3. Only if that's successful, then ask for permission to make the next smallest change (repeat step 1 and 2)


    - prefer to get to a working state first
    - for example: 

## Tasks

- All code changes should correspond to a checkbox in tasks/
- When a change is completed
    - run `make build` to confirm it doesn't break anything
    - update the checkbox in tasks/
- If all checkboxes are checked, update tasks/README.md and rename the task file from TODO to DONE.
