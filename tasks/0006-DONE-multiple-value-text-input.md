# Multiple Value Text Input Support

## Status: DONE
Date: 2025-01-03

## Description

Added support for toggling multiple value input for text fields. This feature allows users to configure text input fields to accept either single or multiple values. The implementation includes proper attribute validation and HTML rendering support.

## Implementation Details

- Added `allowsTogglingMultiple` function to determine if a field supports multiple value toggle
- Modified `mustBeOptional` to handle field optionality independently from multiple value support
- Added `OnMultipleToggle` message type for handling multiple value toggle events
- Added UI controls for toggling multiple value support
- Implemented `maybeMultipleOf` helper function for field properties
- Added `attributesFromTuple` function to properly handle HTML attribute rendering, especially for the multiple attribute
- Improved attribute validation with proper handling of AttributeGiven, AttributeInvalid, and AttributeNotNeeded states

## Changes Made

- Modified `src/Main.elm` to add multiple value support
- Updated form field builder UI to include multiple value toggle checkbox
- Added validation and state management for multiple value fields
- Improved HTML attribute handling for multiple value fields
- Separated multiple value support from field optionality logic

## Testing

The feature has been tested through:
- Unit tests in the test suite
- Manual testing in the form builder interface
- End-to-end testing with form submission
- Validation of HTML attribute rendering
